      Every Web Developer must have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Take a good look at it, especially the new array functions in Javascript. While we know the name Javascript, it is ECMAScript, the language standard that defines new features, capabilities and the evolution of this language.
    </p>

    <p>Managed by the TC-39 committee at ECMA, the language undergoes annual revisions with new features and improvements making land fall, and ultimately making life easier for the millions of JavaScript developers out there.</p>

      "The Solitary Reaper" is a lyric by English Romantic poet William Wordsworth, and one of his best-known works. The poem was inspired by him and his sister Dorothy's stay at the village of Strathyre in the parish of Balquhidder in Scotland in September 1803.
 
      "The Solitary Reaper" is one of Wordsworth's most famous post-Lyrical Ballads lyrics. The words of the reaper's song are incomprehensible to the speaker, so his attention is free to focus on the tone, expressive beauty and the blissful mood it creates in him. The poem functions to "praise the beauty of music and its fluid expressive beauty", the "spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity" that Wordsworth identified at the heart of poetry.

      William Shakespeare was a renowned English poet, playwright, and actor
      born in 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon. ... Shakespeare was a prolific
      writer during the Elizabethan and Jacobean ages of British theatre
      (sometimes called the English Renaissance or the Early Modern Period).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At
      the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three
      children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and
      1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and
      part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later
      known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have
      retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of
      Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable
      speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his
      sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to
      him were written by others.
